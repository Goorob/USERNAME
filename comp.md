# how does the computer works ?
The computer does its primary work in a part of the machine we cannot see, a control center that converts data input to information output. This control center, called the central processing unit (CPU), is a highly complex, extensive set of electronic circuitry that executes stored program instructions. All computers, large and small, must have a central processing unit. As Figure 1 shows, the central processing unit consists of two parts: The control unit and the arithmetic/logic unit. Each part has a specific function.
# Logic circuits
At the most basic level, of course, a computer is an electrical circuit build using wires. We'll think of each wire in the circuit as carrying a single information element, called a bit. The word bit comes from Binary digIT, using the term binary because a bit can have either of two possible values, 0 and 1. In electrical terms, you can think of zero volts representing 0 and five volts representing 1; but for our purposes, the specific voltages aren't important â€” and indeed there are varying systems for interpreting voltage levels as 0 or 1. (People have experimented with more than two different voltage levels, but this ends up leading to circuits that are more complex and end up being less effective than the binary system.
